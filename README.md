# data-analysis-webapp-nodejs-express

This website is built for data team use.

The webapp runs on node.js and uses Mongodb as database to store data and user info.

Before running this webapp on your local PC, you need to install mongoDB on your local PC. The detail installation is located on 
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/. <br>
Additionally, you need to modify the url in the database.js file to include your own database.<br>
Once everything goes well on the database stuff, you can run the app normally.
